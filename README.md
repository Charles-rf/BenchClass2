## **Website:**



## **Description**

This BenchClass web application allows users to find, register, and participate in bench class sessions. It leverages several technologies and components to provide a seamless experience. Here are the key components of the BenchClass app:

* **GitHub Actions:** GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). It automates the build, test, and deployment processes whenever new code is pushed to the repository. This ensures that the latest changes are always deployed to the production environment.

* **Azure SQL Database:** Azure SQL Database is used to store and manage the application's data. It provides a reliable and scalable database solution for storing user information, bench class details, and other relevant data.

* **Azure WebApp:** Azure WebApp is utilized to host the BenchClass web application. It provides a scalable and managed platform for running the ASP.NET MVC application built with .NET 6. Users can access the website and interact with its features through their web browsers.

* **ASP.NET MVC (with .NET 6):** The BenchClass web application is built using ASP.NET MVC, which is a framework for building web applications on the .NET platform. With the latest version of .NET 6, developers can take advantage of the enhanced performance, improved developer productivity, and new features offered by the framework.

These technologies work together to create a robust and user-friendly web application for bench class registration and participation. The Azure SQL Database ensures data persistence, while Azure WebApp provides a reliable and scalable hosting environment. With the power of ASP.NET MVC and .NET 6, the BenchClass app delivers a responsive and feature-rich user interface.

## **Known Issues / Improvements**:

There are many potential enhancements that could be made to the API in the future, including:

* Direct Messaging: Implement direct messaging functionality to allow users to communicate with each other within the app.
* Enhanced Search and Filtering: Improve search and filtering capabilities for easier gym and bench class discovery.
* Rating and Reviews: Add a rating and review system for gyms and bench class sessions to facilitate feedback sharing.
* Social Integration: Integrate social media platforms and enable social sharing features.
